Estimating the plausibility of RNA self-reproduction is central to
origin-of-life scenarios but self-reproduction has been shown in only a handful
of systems. Here, we populated a vast sequence space of ribozymes using
statistical covariation models and secondary structure prediction.
Experimentally assayed sequences were found active as far as 65 mutations from a
reference natural sequence. The number of potentially generated sequences
together with the experimental success rate indicate that at least âˆ¼1039 such
ribozymes may exist. Randomly sampled artificial ribozymes exhibited
autocatalytic self-reproduction akin to the reference sequence. The combination
of high-throughput screening and probabilistic modeling considerably improves
our estimation of the number of self-reproducing systems, paving the way for a
statistical approach to the origin of life.
