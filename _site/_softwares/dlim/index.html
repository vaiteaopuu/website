<p>D-LIM (Direct-Latent Interpretable Model) is a neural network that enhances
genotype-fitness mapping by combining interpretability with predictive accuracy.
It assumes independent phenotypic influences of genes on fitness, leading to
advanced accuracy and insights into phenotype analysis and epistasis. The model
includes an extrapolation method for better understanding of genetic
interactions and integrates multiple data sources to improve performance in
low-data biological research.</p>
