Don't let the simplicity of this question fool you! Indeed, protein design hides
multiple fundamental questions - which essentially shows how little we know
about these very well-known molecules.

Roughly speaking, two approaches are fighting: i) machine learning takes natural
protein examples to design new ones, and ii) physics explicitly models the
details hidden in protein atoms! I followed the second option, where in
collaboration with experimentalists, we not only designed proteins for molecular
structure stability but also new catalytic proteins (enzymes). The methods we
worked on are implemented in the <a
