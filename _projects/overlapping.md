There is a natural process by which one gene can hide another gene; these genes
are called overlapping genes. This is due to two features of the genetic code:
DNA is read by codons (triplets of nucleotides), and the genetic code is
redundant. Overlapping genes have multiple implications in evolutionary theories
but not only. We devised an algorithm that can somehow "morph" two genes such
that in the end both are intricated (overlap). You could only diferenciate the
first gene from the second by reading the genetic sequence in a special way.
